Suppose you generate n random integers between 0 and N. How many unique values do you expect? (Your random numbers might repeat!) Find a formula that expresses this number: unique_values(n,N) = ??? Experiment with various values of n and N. Repeat each experiment several times (with different random seeds) to get a more reliable estimates of the number of unique numbers youâ€™ve generated. Are the results of experiments consistent with your formula?

Deliver: a .zip file containing a single Jupyter notebook (in Python 3.x) that documents your theoretical considerations, experiments and conclusions.

Deadline: 12th October 23:30.

Reward: knowledge + constructive feedback + grade (which will not count, but will give you an idea of what we expect from you in the future).

Bonus task: Design, implement and test any hash function that can be applied to strings (e.g., words), returning 32bit unsigned integers (uint32). It is sufficient if you find and test such a function somewhere.
